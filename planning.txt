Renderable():
  inputs:
    vertices
    colors
  outputs:
    IO 

Transformable():
  inputs:
    position
    angle
  outputs:
    vertices

Colored():
  inputs:
    color
  outputs:
    colors

(Transformable, Colored) -> Renderable

Car(Transformable, Colored):
  inputs:
    models
  outputs:
    vertices
    colors

^ That's too complicated.  Let's make it more atomic.

Renderable(vertices, colors):
  outputs:
    IO 

SolidColored_Rotateable_RegularPolygon(n,r,color,pos,angle):
  n,r and color are immutable
  pos and angle are mutable
  xhelper and yhelper are internal state

  outputs:
    vertices
    colors
